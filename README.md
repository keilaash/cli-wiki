# cli-wiki

A CLI-based personal wiki built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to document and share tools, commands, and concepts related to development, server administration, security, and more.

## About

I’m a student passionate about learning. I want to learn more about Linux cli tools and I am documenting what I have learnt here. This project is my attempt to create a structured knowledge base while learning. Contributions are welcome, let’s build and learn together!

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress

This wiki is in **early development** and evolving constantly. Many sections are still incomplete or rough drafts. Expect updates, changes, and occasional reorganization as I build it out.

Your feedback and contributions can really help shape it.

## ✍️ Wiki Format & Philosophy

This wiki is designed to be:

- **Simple**: Focused, clear explanations without unnecessary jargon.
- **Straightforward**: Minimal fluff — just what you need to understand and apply.
- **Scenario-Based**: Includes practical examples to show real-world usage.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Easy to follow, even if you're just starting out.

Each section aims to answer:
> *What is this? Why use it? How do I use it effectively?*

Examples are included where needed to clarify usage and help users quickly grasp concepts.

If you contribute, please follow this style so the wiki stays clean and approachable for everyone.
