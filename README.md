# cli-wiki

A CLI-based personal wiki built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to document and share tools, commands, and concepts related to development, server administration, security, and more.

## About

I’m a student passionate about learning. I wanted to learn more about Linux cli tools and I am documenting what I have learnt here. This project is my attempt to create a structured knowledge base while learning. Contributions are welcome — let’s build and learn together!

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress

This wiki is in **early development** and evolving constantly. Many sections are still incomplete or rough drafts. Expect updates, changes, and occasional reorganization as I build it out.

Your feedback and contributions can really help shape it.
