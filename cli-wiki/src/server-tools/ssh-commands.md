# SSH Key Setup Guide for Git and Remote Access

This guide helps you **generate and use an SSH key** for secure authentication with GitHub and remote servers.

## What is an SSH Key, and Why Use It?

**SSH (Secure Shell)** keys are a secure way to **authenticate** without using a password. Like GPG keys, SSH uses a **key pair**:

* Your **private key** stays on your computer.
* Your **public key** is shared with remote services (like GitHub or a server).

### Why Use SSH Keys?

*  **Secure logins** without typing passwords
*  **Authenticate Git operations** (clone, push, pull) securely
*  **Access remote servers** with one command

> GitHub and many servers prefer SSH over HTTPS for better security and ease of use.

## 1. Generate a New SSH Key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* Use `ed25519` (modern, faster, more secure than RSA)
* When prompted, save to the default path: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
* Optionally set a passphrase for extra protection

## 2. Add SSH Key to Agent

Start the agent and add your key:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

> If using a custom filename, replace with your actual key path.

---

## 3. Add SSH Key to GitHub

1. Copy the **public key**:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

2. Go to [GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)

3. Click **"New SSH Key"**, give it a title, and paste your public key

---

## 4. Test GitHub SSH Connection

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If successful, you'll see a message like:

```
Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated.
```

---

## 5. Connect to Remote Server

To SSH into a server:

```bash
ssh user@host
```

Replace `user` with your server username and `host` with IP or domain name.

---

## 6. Copy SSH Key to Server

Quickly add your public key to a remote server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@host
```

> Adds your key to the server’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file

---

## 7. Use SSH Config File for Convenience

Set up shortcuts and default identities.

Edit: `~/.ssh/config`

```ssh
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host my-server
  HostName example.com
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now you can connect with:

```bash
ssh github.com
ssh my-server
```
