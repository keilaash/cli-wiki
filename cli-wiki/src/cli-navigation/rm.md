# `rm` Command Guide for Moving and Renaming Files

This guide explains how to use the `rm` (remove) command to delete files and directories safely in Unix-like systems.

## What is `rm`, and Why Use It?

The `rm` command is used to **delete files or directories permanently** from the file system.

### Why Learn `rm`?

* **Free up space** by removing unnecessary files
* **Clean up** scripts, logs, or temporary data
* **Essential for file management** in any Unix/Linux system

> ⚠️ **Warning**: `rm` does **not** move files to the trash — it deletes them immediately. Use it with care.

## 1. Remove a Single File

```bash
rm file.txt
```

* Deletes `file.txt` from the current directory.

---

## 2. Remove Multiple Files

```bash
rm file1.txt file2.txt
```

* Deletes both files at once.

---

## 3. Prompt Before Deleting (Safer)

```bash
rm -i file.txt
```

* `-i` (interactive) asks for confirmation before each deletion.

---

## 4. Remove a Directory and Its Contents

```bash
rm -r my_folder/
```

* `-r` (recursive) deletes the folder and all files/subfolders inside it.

---

## 5. Force Delete Without Prompt

```bash
rm -rf some_folder/
```

* `-f` (force) skips confirmation.
* `-r` ensures folders and their contents are deleted.

> ⚠️ Only use `rm -rf` when you're **absolutely sure** — it cannot be undone.

---

## 6. Verbose Mode (Show What’s Being Deleted)

```bash
rm -v file.txt
```

* `-v` (verbose) prints each file as it's removed.

> For safer usage, many users create an alias like `alias rm='rm -i'` to avoid accidents. Always double-check what you're removing — especially with wildcards like `*` or recursive flags.
