# Text Processing Tools
Text processing is a core part of shell scripting and CLI work. It allows you to extract, transform, and filter data from text files, logs, command outputs, and more.

This section introduces powerful tools like:

- `grep` for searching patterns
- `awk` for pattern scanning and processing
- `sed` for stream editing
- `xargs` for building and executing command lines

These tools are essential for data extraction, automation scripts, and efficient command-line workflows.
