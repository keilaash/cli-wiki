# Shell Scripting
Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks in Unix-based systems using command-line interpreters such as `bash`, `zsh`, or `sh`. A shell script is simply a text file containing a series of commands that are executed in sequence.


## Why Learn Shell Scripting?
- **Automation**: Save time by automating repetitive tasks like backups, deployments, and data processing.
- **Efficiency**: Combine multiple command-line utilities into a single workflow.
- **System Administration**: Perform system tasks such as user management, log parsing, and service monitoring.
- **Portability**: Scripts can be shared and run across different Linux/Unix systems.


## What You'll Need
- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- A terminal or shell (typically Bash)
- A basic understanding of command-line commands


## Hello World Example
Here’s a very basic shell script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
````

Save this as `hello.sh`, make it executable, and run it:
```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

This will print:
```
Hello, World!
```


## Common Shells
* `bash` – Bourne Again SHell (most common)
* `sh` – Bourne Shell (standard POSIX shell)
* `zsh` – Z Shell (feature-rich)
* `fish` – Friendly Interactive Shell (user-friendly)
