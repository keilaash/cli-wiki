# Docker Performance Tips
Improve the efficiency and speed of your Docker containers and build processes with these performance tips.


## 1. Use Multi-Stage Builds
Multi-stage builds help reduce image size by keeping only what is necessary in the final image.
```Dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
CMD ["/myapp"]
```


## 2. Optimise Dockerfile Layers
Group related commands together to reduce the number of layers and cache misses.


## 3. Leverage Build Cache
Order Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changed to maximise cache efficiency.


## 4. Use `.dockerignore`
Prevent unnecessary files from being sent to the Docker daemon during build.
```
node_modules
.git
*.log
```


## 5. Use Lightweight Base Images
Smaller base images like `alpine` reduce image size and pull time.


## 6. Limit Logging Overhead
Use appropriate log drivers and avoid excessive logging.


## 7. Use Volumes for Persistent Data
Volumes are faster and more reliable than bind mounts.
```bash
docker run -v mydata:/data ...
```


## 8. Avoid Large Layers
Install packages and remove caches in a single `RUN` instruction.
```Dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache curl && rm -rf /var/cache/*
```


## 9. Tune Resource Limits
Appropriately configure `--memory`, `--cpus`, and `--ulimit` to avoid resource contention.


## 10. Use Performance Monitoring
Use tools like `cAdvisor`, `Prometheus`, and `Grafana` to monitor container resource usage.
