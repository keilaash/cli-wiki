# Containers
This section covers containerisation technologies and tools.


## Overview
Containerisation is a method of packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated, lightweight units called **containers**. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system’s kernel, making them more resource-efficient and faster to start.


## Why Containers?
- **Consistency**: Run the same app in dev, staging, and production.
- **Isolation**: Apps run in separate environments without interfering.
- **Portability**: Move containers across environments or cloud providers with ease.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for microservices and dynamic workloads.


## Topics Covered
- Conceptual understanding of containers
- Docker as a container platform
- Container orchestration tools (e.g., Docker Swarm, Kubernetes)
- Best practices for working with containerised applications


## Docker
**Docker** is a popular platform that simplifies building, running, and managing containers. It provides:

- A standard format for container images
- Tools for defining and managing container lifecycles
- Support for networks, volumes, and multi-container apps

You’ll find Docker used widely in both development and production environments.

> For detailed usage, syntax, and examples, see the dedicated Docker sections.


## Kubernetes and Orchestration
As applications grow, managing containers manually becomes inefficient. Orchestration tools help automate:

- Deployment
- Scaling
- Networking
- Rolling updates and fault recovery

We cover:

- **Docker Swarm**: A simple, native Docker orchestration system.
- **Kubernetes**: A powerful, production-grade orchestration platform widely used in cloud-native environments.


## Best Practices
When working with containers:

- **Use minimal base images** (e.g., `alpine`) to reduce attack surface and size.
- **Separate concerns**: One service per container.
- **Handle secrets securely** — don’t bake credentials into images.
- **Scan images regularly** for vulnerabilities.
- **Use orchestration** for production workloads.
- **Clean up unused resources** to avoid clutter and reclaim space.


## Further Topics

- Container registries (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)
- CI/CD (Continuous integration / Continuous Deployemet) pipelines with container integration
- Comparing containers to virtual machines
- Container security principles and tooling


> Containers form the backbone of modern DevOps, microservices, and cloud-native architecture. Understanding them sets the stage for efficient, scalable, and reliable application delivery.
